# GreekWarriors Char Packs
Here you can find some of available char packs where you can import and play in game.

What are char packs?
Char packs is a method I created to be able to add your own characters and play with them in my game.

How it works and how you can make your own char pack:
1st step: You must have a folder with char name (for example "Test123") + the following folders inside previous one 
("BackImages", "BackMusic", "BombExplodeSounds", "BombImage", "BulletImages", "CharImage",
"EnemiesImages", "GameOverSounds", "ThrowBulletSounds", "ThrowBombSounds", "WinSounds")

2nd step: Import the data that game needs(music and any sound effects you want in .mp3/.wav format and any images you want in .png/.jpg/.jpeg format)

3rd step: Place the folder in the right path:

Windows: %userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\
<companyname>\<productname>
Android: /Android/data/<packagename>/files

4th step: Enter the folder name that you made for your character and press play. If everything is fine, the game will start as expected.

If you don't know what to add in your character, here's a list of things you can skip and what will happen:

Background images(The main menu background image will appear), background music(You won't have any music in background), bomb explode sounds(The default bomb explode sound will play),
bomb image(The default bomb image will be shown), game over sounds(You won't have any game over sound), throw bullet sounds(You won't have any bullet throw sound),
throw bomb sounds(You won't have any throw bomb sound), win sounds(You won't have any win sound).

If you skip anything else which game needs, an error message will appear in the right side of screen, describing the corresponding issue.
